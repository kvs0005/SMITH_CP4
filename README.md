# Augustus: A Guide to *ab initio* Gene Prediction
**Introduction**
Augustus, developed by Mario Stanke and Stephan Waak, was released to the public in 2003 for the purposes of improving *ab initio* gene predictions. The term *ab initio* is Latin for “from the beginning”. This type of gene prediction relies on the genomic DNA sequence itself to identify genes rather than using outside sources. ab initio prediction software like Augustus are useful when:
- You are working with a species that does not have a well annotated genome. This is particularly true for when you species also does not have a closely related relative with an annotated genome.
- It is relevant that gene predictions be made using genomic structure rather than sequence similarity. This is important to consider if you are working with a poorly represented group.
